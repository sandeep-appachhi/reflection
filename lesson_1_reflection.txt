1.How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It will let us know what all the changes we have made to version of file. Accordingly we can revert it back.

2.How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will reduce the effort and time in finding bugs

3.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    1. GIT
		Pros :
			->We can identify which version is good.
		cons :
			-> manual effor is needed.
	2. Google doc
		Pros :
			-> Manual work is not needed. 
		cons :
			-> we will not get to know which version is better.

4.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	In case of GIT, It allows to find difference between each of the file in single commit.

5.How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    If we want to see the commits then we can use the 'git logs' and if we want to see the difference between the
    version of the file then we can use 'git diff'

6.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   	Even if it break we will be having confident that it can easily identify the bugs using git diff

7.Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To try the different versions of the products.
